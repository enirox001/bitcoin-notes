**PR:** [#33633](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33633) **Author:** maflcko **Type:** Test Refactor

## PR Analysis

This PR refactors the `test_framework.py` file. The main goal is to move several binary-related utility functions from `test_framework.py` to `util.py`. This change makes these standalone utilities available for external use.

---

## Files Changed

1. `test_framework.py`: The methods being refactored were moved from this file.
2. `util.py`: This file houses standalone, modular utilities used across the test framework. The refactored methods were moved here.

## Concept Review

The concept is solid. The `test_framework.py` file is already large and is crucial to the entire functional test suite, so keeping it clean and modular is important.

Placing standalone methods and classes within `test_framework.py` is unnecessary and can cause future issues. For example, users might struggle to access a supposedly standalone function, or unrelated modifications could inadvertently break it. As its name suggests, `util.py` is the appropriate location for these utilities.

Moving these functions into `util.py` is a sound approach that improves modularity and promotes a clear separation of concerns.

**Concept ACK**

## Code Review

Here is a commit-by-commit review:

- **[test: Move get_binary_paths and Binaries to util.py](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33633/commits/fa9f495308afdc3c9c1a98a8a28234340986eb53)**: Since this commit introduces a minimal change, it's straightforward to review. The commit removes imports related to the internal implementation of the `Binaries` class and `get_binary_paths` function from `test_framework.py` and imports them from `util.py` instead.
    
    The `Binaries` class definition is removed, and `self.binary_paths` is updated to call the newly imported `get_binary_paths` function. The `self.config` object is now passed as a parameter to this function. This is necessary because the function no longer has direct access to the `config` attribute in its new location.
    
    In `util.py`, the necessary imports are added, and the `Binaries` class and `get_binary_paths` function are moved here. No changes to the `Binaries` class were needed, as it's already self-contained.
    
- **[move export_env_build_path to util.py](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin/pull/33633/commits/fa75ef4328f638221bcf85fcbefa885122084622)**: The code block for setting up the environment path, previously located in `test_framework.py`, is refactored into a new `export_env_build_path` function in `util.py`. This improves code clarity. The `config` parameter is also passed to this function.
    

I reviewed `test_framework.py` for other refactoring opportunities, but the `Binaries` class and the environment setup logic were the most obvious candidates. The rest of the file appears well-structured.

**Code ACK**

## Nit

1. **Nano nit:** A docstring or comment for the new `export_env_build_path` function in `util.py` would be helpful. Its purpose was self-evident within the setup block of `test_framework.py`, but now that it's a standalone utility, a comment would clarify its purpose and intended use.

---

## Testing Review

I performed the following tests:

1. Built the project successfully.    
2. Ran the full functional test suite.

Since this is a simple refactor, the fact that all functional tests pass confirms that the changes are self-contained and introduce no regressions.

**Tested ACK**

## Verdict

This is an excellent and welcome change. Refactoring these components out of `test_framework.py` improves the code's structure, clarity, and separation of concerns.

**ACK**
